# Linked-List
Linked List is a common data structure in Computer Science that become the foundation for more complex data structure there is. Data structure is a linear data structure that says, if you want to access some data in the list you have to go through all the list one by one from the head

## Functions 
1. Append(value) adds a new node containing value to the end of the list
2. Prepend(value) adds a new node containing value to the start of the list
3. Size() returns the total number of nodes in the list
4. Head() returns the first node in the list
5. Tail() returns the last node in the list
6. At(index) returns the node at the given index
7. Pop() removes the last element from the list
8. Contains(value) returns true if the passed in value is in the list and otherwise returns false.
9. Find(value) returns the index of the node containing value, or null if not found.
10. toString() represents your LinkedList objects as strings.
11. insertAt(value, index) that inserts a new node with the provided value at the given index.
12. removeAt(index) that removes the node at the given index.

## How it's work
You can fork the repo and clone it to your local machine, and run nodemon in your terminal and make sure you have nodemon installed on your local
